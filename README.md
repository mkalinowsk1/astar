# A\* Algorithm Visualization in Go

This repository contains a visual implementation of the A\* (A-star) algorithm, developed in Go (Golang). A\* is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm, widely used in applications such as game development, navigation systems, and robotics. This project showcases a dynamic, interactive visualization of the algorithm, enabling users to understand its step-by-step execution.
## Technologies Used
